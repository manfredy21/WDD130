                <p class="description-parra">
                    The pupusa is a thick corn or rice dough-based tortilla filled with one or more ingredients, such as cheese, pork rinds, squash, refried beans, loroco, etc. Due to its tradition, versatility and low cost, it is one of the most widespread foods in El Salvador and Honduras, countries that dispute their patrimonial origin. Although its origin is unknown for certain, it is most likely a mestizo dish, between native Mesoamerican cuisine and the Spanish culinary tradition that was imported during colonization and subsequent migrations. Several recent scholars affirm that the pupusa has a Quich√© Mayan origin.

                <h3>What it is a Tamal?</h3>
                <p class="description-parra">
                    Tamales are a dish that is part of the typical food of El Salvador and it is believed that they were prepared before the Spanish conquest. In addition, they were considered as a sacred food, typical of the gods.
                    This food can be prepared with different ingredients, flavors and recipes. The preparation, dough, filling, wrapper, as well as the shape of the tamale can vary a bit depending on the country or region.

                <p class="description-parra">
                    Salvadoran pastelitos, also called salvadoran empanadas, are a type of stuffed, fried, succulent and crunchy empanadas that have become one of the most popular and simple fast foods in the country.
                    Pastelitos are nothing more than small pies or cakes.

                    They are traditional from several Latin American countries. In Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean, the Caribbean coast of Colombia, Uruguay, and Panama, they resemble tamales.

                    In Hawaii, they are called patties.

                    The cakes can be sweet or savory.

                    Pastel is a Spanish and Portuguese word and is the name of different typical dishes from many countries that speak these languages.
