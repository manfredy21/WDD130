                    The civilization of El Salvador dates back to pre-Columbian times, around 1500 BC, as evidenced by the ruins of Tazumal and Chalchuapa. The first inhabitants were the Pocomames, Lencas, and Pipiles, who settled in the central and western areas of the country in the mid-11th century.

                <p>
                    Spanish Admiral Andrés Niño led an expedition to Central America and landed on Isla Meanguera, located in the Gulf of Fonseca, on May 31, 1522. This was the first Salvadoran territory visited by the Spanish.

                    In June 1524 the Spanish Captain Pedro de Alvarado began a war of conquest against Cuzcatlán (land of precious things) which was populated by the country's native tribes. After 17 days of bloody battles, many natives and Spaniards died, including the indigenous chief Atlacatl. Pedro de Alvarado defeated and wounded in his left hip, gave up the fight and retired to Guatemala, commissioning his brother, Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue with the conquest of Cuzcatlán. Later, his cousin Diego de Alvarado established the town of San Salvador in April 1525, in a place called La Bermuda, near the city of Suchitoto. In 1546, Carlos I of Spain granted San Salvador the title of city.

                    During the following years, the country evolved under Spanish rule. Towards the end of the year 1810, a feeling of freedom arose among the peoples of Central America and the moment to break the chains of slavery arrived at dawn on November 5, 1811, when the priest José Matías Delgado, replied the bells of the La Merced Church. in San Salvador, calling for an insurrection. After many internal struggles, the Central American Independence Act was signed in Guatemala on September 15, 1821. This day we commemorate the Independence Day of our land of Cuzcatleca.
